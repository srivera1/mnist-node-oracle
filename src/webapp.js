 * NAME
 *   webapp.js
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   A web based application displaying MNIST model front end.
 *
 *   The script creates an HTTP server listening on port 7000 and accepts a URL
 *   parameter for the MNIST image, for example: http://localhost:7000/0,0,1,0, ...
 *
 *   In some networks forced pool termination may hang unless you have
 *   'disable_oob=on' in sqlnet.ora, see
 *   https://node-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/connection_handling.html#limiting-the-time-taken-to-execute-statements
 *
 *   In production applications, set poolMin=poolMax (and poolIncrement=0)
 *
